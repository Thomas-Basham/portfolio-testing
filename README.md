# Portfolio Testing

## Integration Tests for my portfolio website and other web application projects I've had the honor to work on

### Installation

- Create and activate virtual environment

```console
pip install playwright
playwright install
pip install pytest-playwright
```

- Modify tests for your application
- Run tests by entering:
  - `pytest`
  - or `pytest --headed --slowmo 500` to be extra fancy.
- See [Getting Started](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro){:target="_blank"} and [Pytest Plugin](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/test-runners){:target="_blank"} for additional details.
